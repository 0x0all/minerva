{"name":"Minerva","tagline":"A redesigned Minerva. It provides matrix programming interface, just like MATLAB. Python bindings and C++ bindings are both available. The resulting code can be run on CPU or GPU. Multi-GPU support is very easy. Please refer to the examples to see how multi-GPU setting is used.","body":"# Minerva: a fast and flexible system for deep learning\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nMake deep learning a home dish.\r\n\r\n## Requirements and Dependencies\r\n\r\nMinerva depends on several packages. If they are not in the system path, please set variable `EXTERN_INCLUDE_PATH` and `EXTERN_LIB_PATH` in `configure.in` accordingly.\r\n\r\n* CUDA 6.5\r\n* cuDNN\r\n* LMDB\r\n* NumPy\r\n\r\nIn addition, Minerva also depends on the following packages. A script `resolve_deps` is provided for automatic resolving of them.\r\n\r\n* Boost\r\n* Boost.NumPy\r\n* glog\r\n* gflags\r\n* Google Test\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\n1. Set `CXX_COMPILER`, and `C_COMPILER` in `configure.in`. `g++-4.8` is recommended.\r\n1. Set `EXTERN_INCLUDE_PATH`, and `EXTERN_LIB_PATH` in `configure.in` to reflect any dependency not in the system path. If there are more than one, use a comma-separated list.\r\n1. `./configure`\r\n1. Change directory into `debug` or `release` and `make`.\r\n\r\n## MNIST data\r\n\r\nhttp://pan.baidu.com/s/1ntsQs0x\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-57231898-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
